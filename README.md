# Econometrics

I wonder this is the toughest course because it covers a lot of mathematic and econometric models. We learned OLS, Multiple regression, 
Indicator variables, Time series, Panel data, Heteroskedasticity (error term is related to Y), Endogenity (X and e correlated, E(e|X) not 0), ...etc.  
In this repository, I attach the assignments.
