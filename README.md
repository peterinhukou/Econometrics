# Econometrics

Econometrics is the toughest course because it covers a lot of mathematic and econometric models. I learned OLS, Multiple regression, 
Indicator variables, Time series, Panel data, Heteroskedasticity (error term is related to Y), Endogenity (X and e correlated, E(e|X) not 0), ...etc. Textbook is "Principles of Econometrics (4th edition)" by R. Carter Hill, William E. Griffiths, Guay C. Lim.

In this repository, I attach 4 assignments accomplished by R. I remember I got 90 for PS1, 100 for each of PS2-PS4. Here I also attach Rimage for each assignment.

I select Nintendo as my project topic. Collecting 38-quarter revenue from Nintendo's website, regressing it with iPhone quantity, I found for 1 unit of iPhone sold, Nintendo's revenue will decrease by US$60.
